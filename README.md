# nextpnr-rapidwright [WIP]

nextpnr is a open-source multi-architecture place-and-route framework
aimed at real-world FPGA silicon. This is an experiment to integrate
nextpnr with RapidWright, an open interface into Xilinx FPGAs.

Currently this project has been designed for UltraScale+ devices only.
Support for UltraScale devices should involve minimal changes, 7-series
support would require significant changes to packing and validity
checking.
